# The Great Cricket Conundrum
![stick_image_2](1689827968897.jpg)
## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data engineering pipeline and analysis tools for processing and exploring cricket match data. The primary focus is on International Twenty over Format (IT20) matches, with an extension to league format matches. The project involves extracting data from JSON files, transforming it into a structured format, and conducting statistical analysis on dismissal methods.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction:** Download and extract IT20 match data from online sources using Python.
- **Data Transformation:** Convert raw JSON data into a structured format for efficient analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Investigate dismissal methods in IT20 matches and league format matches.

## Motivations

- **Understanding Dismissal Patterns:** Gain insights into the distribution of dismissal methods in different cricket formats.
- **Strategic Implications:** Analyze the implications of dismissal patterns on in-game tactics and strategies.
- **Future works:** Potential implementation of predictors for setting and chasing targets using machine learning algorithms. Explore the generation of advanced statistics to evaluate player performances.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:** Python code for downloading and extracting IT20 match data in JSON format (pull_data.py).
- **Data Engineering:** Functions for transforming JSON data into a structured pandas DataFrame(pull_data.py).
- **Result:** PDF and HTML report analyzing dismissal methods and other relevant statistics.
